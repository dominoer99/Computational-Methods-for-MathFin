Main Topics:
- Quadrature for numerical integration: option pricing with known density
- Fourier Transform and Inverse Fourier Transform: option pricing with unknown density and known characteristic function
- Optimization: optimal portfolio construction (matrix diagonalization & pseudo-inverse); implied volatility surface calibration (Lagrange multiplier, root-finding)
- Risk Neutral Density Recovery: Breeden-Litzenberger method
- PDE Discretization: Barrier option pricing (finite difference approximation, explicit & implicit Euler scheme)
- Monte Carlo Simulation: path-dependent option pricing, e.g. Heston model
- Random Number Generator: SDE discretization, inverse transform method, acceptance-rejection method
